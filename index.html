		<h1>THE DEAL</h1>
			<h2>The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, face down. Each player's stack of cards is face down, in front of them.</h2>
		<h1>THE PLAY</h1>
			<h2>Each player turns up a card at the same time by clicking the player 1 deck - blue deck - and the player with the higher card value takes both cards and they are automatically added to their respective tally. If the cards are the same value, it's WAR!
			    Each player is dealt 3 cards automatically - no need to hit the button again. The fourth card is placed face up, the higher card wins, and all those cards are added to the winner's tally. WAR! continues until the battle is won. </h2>	
		<h1>YOU WIN!...or lose</h1>
			<h2>The game ends when one player has won all 52 cards.</h2>
		<h1>End Early</h1>
			<h2>If you decide to opt for peace and end prematurely, press the "I want peace!" button and player 1 will automatically receive all 52 cards.</h2>
		<h1>Let's Play</h1>
			<h2>In order to start playing press the Render Game button below.</h2>
		<h1>Play Again</h1>
			<h2>If you want to play again or reset the game hit the Render Game button.</h2>
