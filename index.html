		<h2>THE DEAL</h2>
			<p>The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, face down. Each player's stack of cards is face down, in front of them.</p>
		</h2>THE PLAY<h2>
			<p>Each player turns up a card at the same time by clicking the player 1 deck and the player with the higher card takes both cards and they are added to their tally. If the cards are the same value, it's WAR!
			   Each player is dealt 3 cards face down into the center of the board. The fourth card is placed face up, the higher card wins, and all those cards are added to the winner's tally. WAR! continues until the battle is won. 
			</p>
		</h2>YOU WIN!...or lose.<h2>
			<p>The game ends when one player has won all the cards.</p>
