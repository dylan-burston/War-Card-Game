# **WAR** A Battle of Cards
## Rules and General Overview
War is a 2 person card game. The deck is shuffled and split evenly between the two players - CPU and Player 1. Then each player flips a card by clicking the player's deck (blue side) and the highest value - regardless of suit - wins the cards in play. First player to collect all 52 cards wins the game. If both cards match then it's war! Each player automatically adds 3 cards to the in play container and the 4th card is flipped, highest card wins the total amount of cards in play - 8.
